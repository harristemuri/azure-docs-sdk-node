      If specified, the client directs that the request is repeatable; that is,
      that the client can make the request multiple times with the same
      Repeatability-Request-Id and get back an appropriate response without the
      server executing the request multiple times. The value of the
      Repeatability-Request-Id is an opaque string representing a
      client-generated, globally unique for all time, identifier for the
      request. It is recommended to use version 4 (random) UUIDs.
