    summary: >-
      Indicates the speed of delay, in seconds-per-minute, of the incoming audio
      or video data during the last minute. The value is greater than zero if
      data is arriving to the live event slower than expected in the last
      minute; zero if data arrived with no delay; and "n/a" if no audio or video
      data was received. For example, if you have a contribution encoder sending
      in live content, and it is slowing down due to processing issues, or
      network latency, it may be only able to deliver a total of 58 seconds of
      audio or video in a one-minute period. This would be reported as two
      seconds-per-minute of drift. If the encoder is able to catch up and send
      all 60 seconds or more of data every minute, you will see this value
      reported as 0. If there was a disconnection or discontinuity from the
      encoder, this value may still display as 0, as it does not account for
      breaks in the data - only data that is delayed in timestamps.
