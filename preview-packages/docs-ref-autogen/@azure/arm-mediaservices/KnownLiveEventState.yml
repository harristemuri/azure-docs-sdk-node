      The live event resources have been allocated, ingest and preview URLs have
      been generated, and it is capable of receiving live streams. At this
      point, billing is active. You must explicitly call Stop on the live event
      resource to halt further billing.

    summary: >-
      This is the initial state of the live event after creation (unless
      autostart was set to true.) No billing occurs in this state. In this
      state, the live event properties can be updated but streaming is not
      allowed.
