  (unless autostart was set to true.) No billing occurs in this state. In this
  state, the live event properties can be updated but streaming is not allowed.
  \

  **Running**: The live event resources have been allocated, ingest and preview
  URLs have been generated, and it is capable of receiving live streams. At this

  resource to halt further billing.
