      Automatically upgrade the node image to the latest version available.
      Microsoft provides patches and new images for image nodes frequently
      (usually weekly), but your running nodes won't get the new images unless
      you do a node image upgrade. Turning on the node-image channel will
      automatically update your node images whenever a new version is available.

      Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch version
      when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same. For

      1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to

      Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch release on
      the latest supported minor version. In cases where the cluster is at a
      version of Kubernetes that is at an N-2 minor version where N is the
      latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest
      supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster is
      running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are
      available, your cluster first is upgraded to 1.18.6, then is upgraded to
      1.19.1.
