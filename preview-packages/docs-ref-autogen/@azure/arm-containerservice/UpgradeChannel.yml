  ### Known values supported by the service

  **rapid**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  release on the latest supported minor version. In cases where the cluster is
  at a version of Kubernetes that is at an N-2 minor version where N is the
  latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest
  supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster is
  running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are
  available, your cluster first is upgraded to 1.18.6, then is upgraded to
  1.19.1. \

  **stable**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  release on minor version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version.
  For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9,
  1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.18.6.
  \

  **patch**: Automatically upgrade the cluster to the latest supported patch
  version when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same.
  For example, if a cluster is running version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9,
  1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, your cluster is upgraded to 1.17.9.
  \

  **node-image**: Automatically upgrade the node image to the latest version
  available. Microsoft provides patches and new images for image nodes
  frequently (usually weekly), but your running nodes won't get the new images
  unless you do a node image upgrade. Turning on the node-image channel will
  automatically update your node images whenever a new version is available. \

  **none**: Disables auto-upgrades and keeps the cluster at its current version
  of Kubernetes.
